It is of some concern to me     that
the terminology used in multi-sections
math courses is not uniform.

Hello Gr\"{a}ce

 In several sections of the course on
 matrix theory, the strange term
    ``hamiltonian-reduced'' is used.
    I, personally, would rather call these
   ``hyper-simple''. I invite others
to \ comment on this problem.

simply put, we believe % actually, it's not so simple
