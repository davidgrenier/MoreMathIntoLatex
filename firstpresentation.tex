    \frametitle{Summary}
    We characterize the order of principal congruences
    of a bounded lattice as a bounded ordered set.
    We~also state a number of open problems in this new field.

    \frametitle{Theorem 1}
    For a bounded lattice $L$, the order $\Princ K$ is bounded.
    We now state the convers.

    \begin{theorem}
        Let $P$ be an order with zero and unit.
        Then there is a bounded lattice~$K$ such that
        \[
            P \cong \Princ K.
        \]
        If $P$ is finite, we can construct $K$ as a finite lattice.
