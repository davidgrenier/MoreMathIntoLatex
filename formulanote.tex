In first-year calculs, we define intervals such as $(u,v)$ and $(u,\infty)$.
Such an interval is a \emph{neighborhood} of $a$ if $a$ is in the interval.
Students should realize that $\infty$ is only a symbol, not a number.
This is important since we soon introduce concepts such as $\lim_{x \to \infty}f(x)$.

When we introduce the derivative
\[
    \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x-a},
\]
we assume that the function is defined and continuous in a neighborhood of $a$.
